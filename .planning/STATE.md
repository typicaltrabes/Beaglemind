## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Develop directly on BeagleHQ server (faster iteration, direct Postgres/Caddy access)
- Existing Postgres instance with new database, tenant isolation via schema not container
- pnpm workspaces monorepo (not Turborepo -- overkill for 3 apps)
- Used Zod v4 import path (zod/v4) for greenfield compatibility
- Added @types/node as root devDependency for Node.js types across all packages
